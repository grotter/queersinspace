textProjectBlue = "Queers in Space's first &quot;space change&quot; was Blue Room; the appropriation and transformation of the light-court at the heart of CED's Wurster Hall. Covering the light-court's windows in pink cellophane and its horizontal surfaces in artificial fur, we temporarily transformed Wurster's neutral concrete being into a vivid inhabitable space. At night the courtyard became Wurster's glowing pink heart. During the day the light-court effervesced a warm pink light into the Design School. Engaging with the larger community, a midnight invitation to come and view the &quot;space change&quot; was placed on each of the 800 studio desks at the CED.<br><br>The installation questioned divisions of space and the site of the marginal as a location for intervention. It announced the presence of Wurster's queer community and stirred the community's interest in Queers in Space.";
