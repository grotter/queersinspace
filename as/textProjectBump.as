In tandem with Architect Joel Sander's lecture at the CED &quot;Ergotectonics: Multi-identity Environments&quot;, BUMPandSLIDE was a series of films projected on the face of Wurster's tower and on a wall adjacent to the entrance. Two separate videos united the tower down to its base changing the scale and reference of the architecture to the individual human body as guests entered and exited the building on the evening of the lecture.";
