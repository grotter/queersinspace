textProjectMuseum2 = "INFORMATIVE HISTORY: Ephemeral Traces<br><br>Queer districts and streets in pre-war San Francisco thrived by the anonymity they offered. As physically segregated spaces within the normative city, the Waterfront, Market Street, the Tenderloin, Montgomery Street, North Beach and the Polk formed a rich [sub]cultural tapestry in which various forms of codified knowledge could thrive. While these emerging identities rose primarily from commercial districts in the city -- neighborhoods characterized by shipping, entertainment and hotels - their cultural milieu was characterized above all by social marginality and fluidity of movement. Strangers and transients dominated &quot;the scene&quot; in areas whose most visible aspects characterized their reputations as centers of the sex trade.<br><br>APPROPRIATE AND DISCLOSE: Memory as the Embodiment of Collective History<br><br>**City Interiors<br><br>The museum's spatial organization reflects the duality of its role as both a repository of personal histories and artifacts and a public nexus of interpretation for the community. At the same time, the opposition of its status as a public forum to the &quot;domesticity&quot; of its contents, fundamentally challenges the elements of disclosure and censorship that are critical in the formation of its spatial identity.<br><br>Inhabiting the site of former storefront/commercial spaces along Market Street, the museum project positions a collective [queer] history at the symbolic juncture of private space that forms and is formed by the public. Moving beyond the facade to claim the space of a single room, followed by a single lot, the museum project moves further still to appropriate a sequentially carved series of chambers within the city fabric, including an alleyway whose own element of highly articulate &quot;display&quot; both highlights and resists the equivalent &quot;disclosure&quot; along the Market Street facades, further complicating the interchange of public and private realms.<br><br>Within this realm of appropriation of the anonymous container, the places of collecting memory (archive) displaying memory (museum) and interpreting memory (juncture between archive and museum) emerge as the interwoven negotiations of public image and private disclosure.<br><br>BEYOND THE FACADE: from Projected Desire to Embodied Experience<br><br>The appropriated anonymity of buildings along Market Street not only speaks to the museum's role as the interpreter of an encoded, hidden culture; it also recalls the historical ephemerality of the queer city, whose coded trace lies embedded within the city fabric, even as it remains imperceptible to the uninitiated. Buildings as sites of queer ephemera are the embodiment of the queer city.<br><br>Similarly, film provides a metaphor for the recording and multi-valent interpretation of communal memory. The medium of film itself comprises a series of stills whose quality of continuous visual narrative requires that the viewer &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; through a constant process of cognitive reconstruction. A kind of imagined potential or projected desire fills the interstices of cinematic space in the same way that MEMORY produces the imagined experiences of past events. In the museum project, streaming projections of film from the archive's collection play across the building's exterior.<br><br>In a related strategy of transient desire, the former storefront on Market Street becomes an intermittent looking glass into the museum's interior as it selectively obscures the outsider's view into the gallery, allowing only fleeting moments of clarity. Subtle shifts in the visibility or materiality of the facade, say, in the form of organza fabric or opacity-polarized glass, produces a shadow theater of presences and movement within. Distinguishable but identifiable figures and features are obscured from view, while momentary lapses of revelation choreograph a rhythm of anonymity and clarity.<br><br>Upon entering the museum a further transformation of expectant desires takes the form of embodied experience. Here the lived experience of collective memory engages the corporeal and gendered presences of visitors to the museum. Exhibition displays and material surfaces provoke the bodily senses in an aggressive attack on the vertical picture plane of the traditional modernist gallery. Bodily orientation, social desire and the desire to touch (indeed to feel) the &quot;forbidden&quot; surfaces of the museum itself reach full fruition. In this sense &quot;queer space&quot; becomes the self-awareness of bodily-rootedness, of the momentary specificity of experience and of discovery.";
