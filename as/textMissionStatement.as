textMissionStatement = "Who We Are:<br><br>Queers in Space is an active student group at the University of California, Berkeley in the College of Environmental Design. We are a fully interdisciplinary design collective engaged in questioning the relationships of gender, sexuality, and the built environment that successfully brings together landscape architecture students and architecture students of both graduate and undergraduate standing. The visibility of our work brought students from other disciplines (art/history) who were also interested in producing collective projects that both challenge and realize this queer intersection of space, material, and being. These germinating connections form the basis for continuing to develop a vibrant activism in the study and production of the built environment at UC Berkeley with Queers in Space as provocateurs and participants.<br><br>Our installations process is formed by identifying opportunities for installations and producing them throughout the year. The installations both provide a fruitful outlet for our collective investigation and produce a physical intervention into the daily life of the College of Environmental Design that engages our student body community with the questions of gender, sexuality and the education of environmental designers.";
